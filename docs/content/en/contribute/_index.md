Stencil relies heavily on the enthusiasm and participation of the open-source community. We need your support in both its development and documentation.

Stencil's contribution guidelines are [detailed in a `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/getoutreach/stencil/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the Stencil source repository on GitHub.
